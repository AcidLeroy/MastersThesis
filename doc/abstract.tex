This thesis proposes an open-source, maintainable system for detecting human
activity in large video datasets using scalable hardware architectures. The
system is validated by detecting writing and typing activities that were
collected as part of the Advancing Out of School Learning in Mathematics and
Engineering (AOLME) project. The implementation of the system using Amazon
Web Services (AWS) is shown to be both horizontally and vertically scalable.
The software associated with the system was designed to be robust so as to
facilitate reproducibility and extensibility for future research.
