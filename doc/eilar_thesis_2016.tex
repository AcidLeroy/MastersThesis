    % This thesis introduces a distributed processing system for analyzing videos
    % acquired through the advancing out of school learning in mathematics and
    % engineering \\ (AOLME)
    %  project. The proposed architecture is demonstrated by
    % detecting writing and typing activities based on the Video Analysis (VIDA)
    % system. VIDA leverages Amazon Web Services (AWS) to optimally distribute
    % segments of video to a heterogenous compute cloud consisting of machines
    % that have both CPU and GPU processing hardware onboard. The master node is
    % responsible for distributing the videos and the slave nodes perform feature
    % reduction on the videos by calculating a handful of cumulative distribution
    % functions (CDF) to then be returned to the master for classification using a
    % support vector machine (SVM). This thesis will demonstrate the accuracy,
    % scalability and flexibility of VIDA for videos collected through AOLME.
    % Furthermore, this thesis delves into the architectural details essential to
    % distributed video processing on cloud infrastructures.

    This thesis proposes a novel human activity recognition in video architecture that
    attempts to solve the challenges associated with processing large video datasets
    in a scalable, maintainable, and accurate way. Using a subset of video data obtained
    by the UNM College of Education through the Advancing Out of School Learning
    in Mathematics and Engineering (AOLME) project, we demonstrate that the
    proposed architecture is both vertically and horizontally scalable using
    Amazon's web services (AWS), and can accurately classify children typing on
    a computer keyboard at 90\%. Furthermore, the software that accompanies this
    thesis is completely open source and was developed with robustness in mind
    to facilitate reproducibility and extensibility for future research.
