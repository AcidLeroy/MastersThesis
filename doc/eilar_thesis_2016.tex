  \begin{abstract}
    This thesis proposes a distributed processing system for analyzing classroom
    videos to assess student learning while they participate in the advancing
    out of school learning in mathematics and engineering (AOLME) project. The
    proposed architecture is demonstrated by detecting writing and typing
    activities based on the Video Distributed Analysis (VIDA) system. VIDA
    leverages Amazon Web Services (AWS) to optimally distribute segments of
    video to a heterogenous compute cloud consisting of machines that have both
    CPU and GPU processing hardware onboard. The master node is responsible for
    distributing the videos and the slave nodes perform feature reduction on the
    videos by calculating a handful of cumulative distribution functions (CDF)
    to then be returned to the master node for analysis using support vector
    machines for classification. This thesis will  demonstrate the accuracy,
    scalability and flexibility of VIDA for videos collected through AOLME.
